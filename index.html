		Friendship has become the solidifying mould that has kept people close for many years through some of the hardest and emotionally draining fights our society has faced such as through poverty, violence and the abuse of human rights and equality.

The International Day of Friendship was founded in 2011 by the UN General Assembly whos main ideologies were that friendship was something to be acclaimed and shared between countries, cultures and individuals. It is celebrated on the 30th July every year and is said to be a day which places emphasis on the young people of the world like yourselves who could one day be our future leaders and presidents, for example. It is a day to be celebrated with the likes of activities being present to contribute to the idea of community within civilizations and to repair misunderstandings and have reconciliations. Friendship to human beings is seen as a noble and valuable sentiment that adds to life, to cherish the moments with those dear to them and to enjoy every experience that is given to them.

Having friendships is extremely important for leading a healthy, happy life. Without having friends around us, we can feel lonely and helpless as in some situations having the surrounding arms of friends can really lift us up and bring us joy. Friendship knows no boundaries, it is universal and it can bring different cultures, religions and backgrounds together to form a special bond which could last forever.

Sometimes, we will wish that our friends are our family instead of our blood relatives. Sometimes you may feel judged, misunderstood or humiliated by your family, but friends can fill this void and give you the opportunity to have a safe place to go to when you’re feeling this way, we can be fixed by our friends metaphorically speaking, they are our lifeline and you should choose them wisely.

“The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other’s life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof.”

“Sometimes our light goes out but is blown into flame by another human being. Each of us owes deepest thanks to those who have rekindled this light.”

   “A good friend is my greatest relation.”
