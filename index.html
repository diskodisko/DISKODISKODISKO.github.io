	<p>Di is a very smol kid, who's really mature for her age- mature enough for oldies like me to be able to get inspo from her or think "what would she do in this situation"; yeh so the point is, I look up to her as a person and she does ofcourse have her periodic brat moments because she's a kid and a human, it's a part of who she is and we love her for that. She's shorter than me and veryy cute; she doesn't like oreos and loves corn.
